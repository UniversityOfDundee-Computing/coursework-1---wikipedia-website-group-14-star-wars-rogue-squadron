      <p>
        After the success of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire on the Nintendo 64
        in 1996, LucasArts began planning a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was
        developing a game engine to create large terrain maps for their planned
        sequel to LucasArts' Rescue on Fractalus! After LucasArts signed a
        three-game exclusivity deal with Nintendo, Factor 5 was allowed to
        convert their work on the new Fractalus sequel into a Star Wars game
        instead. The game's focus would be flight combat; this direction was
        inspired by a level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a
        snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and LucasArts
        production manager Brett Tosti stated, "That whole scene was actually
        the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't you do
        a whole game like that?' So we did." Factor 5 and LucasArts divided the
        game's development load. Factor 5 designed the game engine, the music,
        and worked closely with Nintendo, while LucasArts produced the game's
        content and ensured it was faithful to Star Wars canon. Factor 5
        initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions
        similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films.
        This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, Lucasfilm was not
        comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films nor would
        they allow original content to be incorporated alongside battles from
        the films. Consequently, the resulting game was almost completely set in
        the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The designers at LucasArts initially
        planned to adapt Rogue Squadron and Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron, a
        series of books and comic books set after the years of the original film
        trilogy, and have the game centered around Wedge Antilles. It was later
        decided that the game would instead focus on Luke Skywalker and
        primarily take place between the events of A New Hope and The Empire
        Strikes Back as it was more commercially appealing. LucasArts began
        developing the story and gameplay in a setting that would include
        characters from the films participating in new, original missions using
        Factor 5's terrain map engine as the base. The development team's basic
        design plan was to combine the free-roaming style of Rescue on Fractalus
        with the on-rails gameplay of Atari's Star Wars arcade game. Initially,
        designing and refining the individualized flight controls for the game's
        various vehicles was difficult for programmer Mark Haigh-Hutchinson
        before breaking through to find the right balance for each. In May 1998,
        a demo of the game was displayed at E3, but the game was so incomplete
        at the time that Tosti considered it a tech demo. It rendered a basic
        heightmap and an immobile AT-AT model, while TIE fighters lacking
        artificial intelligence flew and fired in a predetermined path. When
        "playing" the demo for audiences, Tosti followed a very specific flight
        path of his own to give the illusion that he was actually battling with
        the TIEs. Despite the demo's barebones presentation, response from
        gamers was largely positive. In the final build of the game, many of the
        enemy fighters continued to follow predetermined flight paths as
        calculating flight paths on the fly required too much processing power.
        Late in development, the team realized that they were developing the
        game with a Nintendo 64 memory expansion in place at all times. Unable
        to run the game on a standard Nintendo 64, they began working on
        compression techniques to allow the game to run within the confines of
        the standard console. At the same time, Factor 5 also appealed to
        Nintendo to release the newly developed memory Expansion Pak
        commercially. Nintendo was reluctant, expecting the technology to be
        reserved solely for hardware peripherals. However, after Iguana
        Entertainment also wanted to use the Expansion Pak to achieve a higher
        display resolution for Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, Factor 5 was given the
        green light. Ultimately, Rogue Squadron was made to run on a standard
        Nintendo 64 but the Expansion Pak increases its resolution from 320 ×
        240 to 640 × 480. Lucasfilm was hesitant to grant access to the Star
        Wars library of sound effects to Factor 5 sound designer Rudolph
        Stember. As a compromise, the company provided Stember with sounds
        sampled at the relatively low rate of 22 kHz, half the standard rate.
        Stember objected, claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he
        had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project. The game
        includes voice work from several notable persons, including screen
        actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob
        Bergen, Neil Ross and Terence McGovern. Instead of using Nintendo's
        default sound drivers, Factor 5 developed its own tool called MOsys FX
        Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, but tax them
        less; advanced compression techniques were also employed. As a result,
        the game includes over 80 minutes of high-quality stereo sound. In
        November 1998, a month before the game's scheduled release, LucasArts
        announced the worldwide agreement with Nintendo concerning three new
        Star Wars video games. It granted Nintendo the rights to market the
        games and hold exclusive, worldwide distribution rights for five years
        following each release. Rogue Squadron was the first game released under
        this agreement. To promote the release of the game, Mark Hamill, the
        actor who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films, visited the
        Mattel Children's Hospital in Los Angeles to play the game with patients
        in a Starlight Children's Foundation's Fun Center.

    <img class="floatright" src="develop1.PNG" style='width:auto; height:300px'><p>Many reviews compared Star Wars: Rogue Squadron to one of its inspirations, the Battle of Hoth flight combat level in Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, considered one of that game's best elements. GamePro remarked that Rogue Squadron "enhanced the flight model with true pitch, roll, and bank mechanics". IGN praised its inclusion of "upgrades, more enemies, better sound, and stunning second-generation graphics". The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews, and received an aggregate score of 85 percent from both GameRankings and Metacritic. GamePro named it one of the best games released in 1998. In a 2008 retrospective, IGN's Levi Buchanan stated that the game revived the Star Wars license on consoles through well-paced gameplay, a story tied into the Star Wars canon, and visuals that made it "one of the generation's top stunners".
      The game's technical aspects were singled out for acclaim. Its visuals were called "respectable" in the standard resolution, but highly praised in high-resolution mode (achieved via the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak). GameSpot remarked that in a higher resolution, "[the] textures of the landscapes, the ships, the lighting effects—everything looks so much better," while IGN's Peer Schneider said, "After playing the game in the optional high-resolution mode (640 × 480) once, it's impossible to go back to the still respectable standard resolution." Citing details such as decals, Rebel markings, R2 units, cockpit views, and exhaust flames, Schneider described the game's 3D ship models as "gorgeous". IGN's Matt Casamassina said that the game was the best-looking Nintendo 64 game to date.
      Reviewers also praised the game's sound design. Powered by the new Factor 5 audio drivers, Rogue Squadron features about 40 minutes of speech and 40 minutes of music. GameSpot's Ryan Mac Donald believed that the game's inclusion of extended voice work helped create a "movie-like" atmosphere. IGN noted that in addition to being technically impressive, the game's Dolby Pro Logic surround sound was an important gameplay element. The audio signals helps the player determine enemy positions and the direction of travel. IGN awarded the game three sound awards, including Sound Effects, Best Voice, and Best Overall Sound of 1998 on the Nintendo 64. The game also earned a nomination for "Game of the Year" at the 2nd Annual AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards).
      Some reviewers complained about aspects of the game's visuals; critics disliked the heavy reliance on distance fog. Another common criticism of the game was the lack of multiplayer modes. GamePro's review called the omission a "serious, unforgivable sin"; Schneider believed that while adding these modes would have extended Rogue Squadron's replay value, the game was still enjoyable for its medal reward system and a large number of secrets and unlockables.
      Although nearly identical, the game's PC version garnered lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart, with an aggregated GameRankings score of 80 percent. This version enjoyed many of the same praises for its gameplay, but handling and graphics were cited as problematic. Directly comparing the two versions, AllGame's Brad Cook wrote that the PC version's handling is more difficult than the N64 version. He believed the PC's "choppy" feel made it difficult to target enemies. In contrast to its opinion of the N64 version, IGN's PC review was not enthusiastic about the game's visuals. IGN staff remarked that Rogue Squadron's "graphics and special effects aren't spectacular" and that they had "seen better graphics" on the PC.</p>
